# Resources for README
<span style="color: red;">The template starts further down, after this resource-section</span>

<br>

Welcome,

This is my template that I use for my Machine Learning projects and it's perfectly okay for you to use this template as the basis for your project too.

I have created a starting structure for the readme, prewrtitten Jupyter notebook cells, presinstalled tools, etc.
I have also, before the start of the real part of the README, created some reources for your README and project in general.

## Use this template to create your GitHub project repo
1. **Go to the Template Repository**: Navigate to this template repository on GitHub.  
2. **Click "Use this template"**: At the top-right of the template repo page, click the green **"Use this template"** button.  
3. **Create the New Repository**: 
    - Enter a name for the new repository.
    - Optionally, add a description and select the visibility (Public or Private).
    - Click **"Create repository from template"**.

## How to Fork a Repository
1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the repository page you want to fork.
3. In the top-right corner of the page, click the "Fork" button.
4. Choose where you want to fork the repository (either to your personal account or an organization).
5. GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account. Wait a few moments for the process to complete.
6. Once the fork is complete, you can navigate to your newly forked repository and begin working on your own copy.

## Instruction on the different files
Not yet written
### Instructions on Versions of Dependencies
The listings in the `requirements.txt` file are provided without specific version numbers to ensure that you start with the latest versions of all dependencies (such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.). This approach allows you to always benefit from the most recent updates and improvements in the libraries.

However, if you wish to "freeze" the versions throughout the project (which is often a good idea to prevent unexpected changes or issues caused by newer library versions), you should do the following:

1. **Freeze Dependency Versions**  
   You can freeze the versions of your dependencies by running the following command after installing them:
   
   `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

   This will generate a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the installed libraries along with their exact versions. By using this `requirements.txt`, you can ensure consistency across different environments, making it easier to replicate the setup without unexpected version issues.

2. **Updating Dependencies**  
   Periodically, you may want to check for newer versions of your dependencies to keep your project up to date. To update all dependencies at once, you can use:
   
   `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

3. **Handling Compatibility Issues**  
   Sometimes, specific versions of libraries may not be compatible with each other. If you encounter any issues after freezing versions, it’s advisable to manually adjust the version numbers in the `requirements.txt` file to ensure compatibility. You can refer to the documentation of each library for guidance on compatible versions.

Additionally, **always update the Python version** in both the `gitpod/Dockerfile` and the `.python-version` file (if you're using a version manager like `pyenv`). This will ensure that the development environment uses the correct Python version and maintains consistency between different setups.

By freezing dependencies and carefully managing versions, you help ensure that the project remains stable and reproducible across different machines and environments.

## Principles of a Good README (in no particular order)
1. Prioritize Important Information
Start with the most useful and essential information at the top. This allows readers to quickly understand the purpose and usage of your project. Gradually include more detailed technical or implementation notes as they progress through the file.

2. File Naming Conventions
Use ASCII and Unicode characters appropriately. Remember that capital letters appear before lowercase letters in sorting, so "README" will often appear at the top of file listings. This ensures visibility.

3. Know Your Audience
Who is your documentation for? A good README is written for your team, collaborators, and potential users who might interact with your code. Ensure it’s clear, concise, and accessible to people with varying levels of technical knowledge.

4. The Importance of Documentation
Documentation is key for efficient collaboration. It helps both current collaborators and future developers understand the codebase, facilitating smoother development and troubleshooting. Over time, you or your team might forget the reasoning behind certain decisions, and good documentation can help recall the thought process that shaped the code.

5. The Role of the README
The README serves as the first point of contact for anyone visiting your project. It helps users understand what the project is about, how to get started, and how to contribute. A well-written README can increase adoption and contribution, as users are more likely to engage with projects that are clearly explained.

6. Why You Should Care About a README
Without a clear README, potential users and contributors might quickly become frustrated or confused. If they don’t know what your software does or how to use it, they’re unlikely to try it or contribute to its development.

Additional Principles for a Good README:
7. Clarity and Simplicity
Keep language simple and free from jargon. Aim for clarity so that users of all skill levels can easily follow the instructions. Avoid overcomplicating explanations—assume that the reader might not be familiar with your codebase or the technologies you're using.

8. Be Concise but Complete
Strike a balance between brevity and thoroughness. Include essential information without overwhelming readers with unnecessary details. A good README should provide enough context to get someone up and running, without drowning them in too much information.

9. Structure and Organization
A well-structured README improves readability and helps users find the information they need. Consider dividing the document into clear sections with headings such as:

Project Title
Description
Installation Instructions
Usage
Contributing
License
Acknowledgements

10. Use Visuals When Necessary
Incorporating images, GIFs, or diagrams can greatly enhance understanding, especially when explaining complex concepts, workflows, or user interfaces. Make sure visuals are relevant and add value.

11. Provide Example Use Cases
Including code examples and use cases helps users understand how to apply the software in real-life scenarios. Show how to run basic commands, configure settings, or integrate with other tools.

12. Maintenance and Contribution Information
Encourage collaboration by including guidelines for contributing to the project. Specify how people can report issues, submit pull requests, or help with documentation.

13. Keep It Up to Date
A README is a living document that should evolve alongside your project. Keep it updated as your project progresses, particularly when there are changes to setup instructions, new features, or changes in functionality.

14. Add a License
Include a section detailing the project's license. This clarifies the terms under which others can use, modify, or distribute your code, which is essential for open-source projects.

## Commit Message Guidelines
Here are some basic principles for writing good commit messages:

- **Use the imperative mood**: Start the message with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update"), as if you are giving a command.
- **Be concise**: The message should be succinct but informative. Aim for the title (or subject) to be under 50 characters.
- **Provide context**: The body (if needed) should explain why the change was made and what exactly was done.
- **Separate subject and body**: If the commit requires a longer explanation, separate the subject line from the body with a blank line. Limit each line of the body to 72 characters.
- **Group related changes**: A single commit should focus on one logical change or fix.

## Dataset Content - OPTIONAL
* Describe your dataset. Choose a dataset of reasonable size to avoid exceeding the repository's maximum size and to have a shorter model training time. If you are doing an image recognition project, we suggest you consider using an image shape that is 100px × 100px or 50px × 50px, to ensure the model meets the performance requirement but is smaller than 100Mb for a smoother push to GitHub. A reasonably sized image set is ~5000 images, but you can choose ~10000 lines for numeric or textual data. 


## Business Requirements - OBLIGATORY
* Describe your business requirements


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them) 


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualized an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course 


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).



## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-24](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
